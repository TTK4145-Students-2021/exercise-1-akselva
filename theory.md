Exercise 1 - Theory questions
-----------------------------
 
 ### What is the difference between concurrency and parallelism?
 > Concurrency means working on different tasks in the same timespan, i.e. starting on a task before another one is finished, and switching between them.
 This allows us to make progress in different tasks in the same time peried. However, only one task may be processed at one exact time.
 
 Parallelism means working on different tasks simultaneously, i.e. at the same exact time. For instance can an application split a single task into subtask that separate
 cores can execute in parallell
 
 ### Why have machines become increasingly multicore in the past decade?
 > 
 
 ### Why do we divide software (programs) into concurrently executing parts (like threads or processes)?
 (Or phrased differently: What problems do concurrency help in solving?)
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### Does creating concurrent programs make the programmer's life easier? Harder? Maybe both?
 (Come back to this after you have worked on part 4 of this exercise)

 ### What is the conceptual difference between threads and processes?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### Some languages support "fibers" (sometimes called "green threads") or "coroutines"? What are they?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### What is the Go-language's "goroutine"? A C/POSIX "pthread"?
 > *Your answer here*
 
 ### In Go, what does `func GOMAXPROCS(n int) int` change? 
 > *Your answer here*
